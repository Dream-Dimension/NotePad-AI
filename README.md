## Build & Run Locally
``` npm run build ```

``` cd buld ```

``` npx http-server ```

* Note to run locally make sure to delete the *homepage* setting in *package.json*. It is using *homepage: "/NotePad-AI/"*, to make the live  github static site work. Setting it to ther options like "." or "./" did not work on github pages but should work locally.
